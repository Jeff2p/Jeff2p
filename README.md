Hello, my name is Jeff.
 I'm passionate about computer hardware design, development, and testing, such as computer systems, circuit boards, electronic components, keyboards, routers and switches, and printers.
I'm in my senior year Western Governors University where I'm majoring in software development.
I'm interested in working with IT development firms as well as industries that develop or utilize computer-based technologies
