Hello, my name is Jeff.
 I'm passionate about computer hardware design, development, and testing, such as computer systems, circuit boards, electronic components, keyboards, routers and switches, and printers.
I'm in my junior year at George Mason University, where I'm learning the fundamentals of programming and how computers work, as well as digital logic, computer structure and architecture, and a lot of Mathematics - Linear transformations, Graph Theory, Boolean Algebra, Operations, and so on.
 I'm interested in working with computer firms as well as industries that develop or utilize computer-based technologies, such as telecommunications, automotive, and aerospace.
 You can contact me by email at jephtha.gyasi@yahoo.com.
